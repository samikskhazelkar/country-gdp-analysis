country GDP analysis focuses on understanding the overall economic performance, growth drivers, and living standards. Here’s a brief overview: 
Key Points: GDP Components: GDP is driven by consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (X - M). Analyzing these components helps identify what drives economic growth, such as strong consumer demand or high levels of business investment.
Nominal vs. Real GDP: Nominal GDP measures economic output at current prices, while Real GDP adjusts for inflation, giving a clearer picture of true economic growth over time.
GDP Per Capita: This is a measure of average economic output per person. Higher GDP per capita suggests a higher standard of living, though it doesn’t account for income inequality.
Sectoral Breakdown: Analyzing GDP by sector (agriculture, industry, services) shows which areas of the economy are contributing most to growth. Developed countries often have large service sectors, while developing countries might rely more on agriculture and manufacturing.
Growth Rates: The GDP growth rate indicates how fast an economy is expanding. High growth rates reflect rapid economic expansion, while low or negative growth may indicate economic challenges or recession.
